-   ### ***Design***
    
    -   #### Colour Palette

        - The colour palette is made up of four colours: 
          - Dark blue #08172F
          - Light blue #BDE5EC
          - Dark brown #9D5E2B
          - White #FFF

        - The first three colours are taken from the hero images, all the while taking into account their compatibility with each other and the site as a whole. White #fff is used as the fourth colour on the site as a neutral tone.

        ![Game Developer History Hero Image Colour Palette](assets/images/color-palette-game-developer-history.png)

        ![Machine Catalogue Hero Image Colour Palette](assets/images/color-palette-machine-catalogue.png)

        ![Sign Up Hero Image Colour Palette](assets/images/color-palette-sign-up.png)
    
    -   #### Typography

        -   The 'Hubballi' and 'Mina' fonts are used across the site, with  Hubballi being used for the body text and Mina for the h1, h2, h3 heading. These fonts were chosen as they resemble the in-game fonts fairly closely, as seen by the [Horizon Zero Dawn Logo](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Logo_Horizon_Zero_Dawn.svg):
        
            ![Horizon Zero Dawn Logo](assets/images/logo-horizon-zero-dawn.png)
    
    -   #### Imagery

        -   Each page has its own hero image to immediately immerse the user into the breath-taking world of the Horizon games - whether it be existing fans of the games or newcomers coming to learn more about the world of Horizon. They are all in-game shots and thus allow the user to imagine themselves in the Horizon universe. 

        -   The other images on the page are of the enemy machines and can be found on the Machine Catalogue page. These images have been selected specifically as they show the machines on their own, without any other characters or other machines, so as to make clear to the user which machine is being described. They are also good-quality, in-game images to give the user the feeling of experiencing the game directly.   

-   ### ***Wireframes***

## __Features__

### ***Existing Features***

- #### Navigation Bar

  ![Nav Bar](assets/images/nav-bar.png)

  - The navigation bar includes five clickable links, allowing the user to easily access the four pages on the site: 
    - Horizon GamePedia site name (links to the About The Games home page)
    - About The Games page
    - Game Developer History page
    - Machine Catalogue page
    - Sign Up page

  - In order to make navigation easier for the user, the navigation bar is in a fixed position, meaning that it remains at the top of the page as the user scrolls down.

  - The navigation bar follows the same style and size as the footer, and appears in the same format on all four pages - this allows for consistency throughout the site.

  - A hover effect of the text turning white is included, allowing the user to understand that the link is clickable. Once the link has been clicked, the text remains white to indicate to the user which page they find themselves on. 

  - The navigation bar was created with HTML and CSS only and is fully responsive across devices.

    ![Responsive Footer](assets/images/footer-responsive.png)

### ***Future Implementations***

- #### General
  
  - Use a [recreation of the in-game font](https://www.fontspace.com/category/horizon-zero-dawn) for headings across the site.

  - Add a Tribe Quiz page with JavaScript, allowing the user to answer questions about their gaming style resulting in being assigned to a tribe from the Horizon universe. 

  - Add a chat room function to the site for users to be able to connect socially. 

  - Improve Lighthouse Performance score on all pages by further compressing image sizes without losing the quality, or by using a next-gen image format such as WebP or AVIF. 

- #### Navigation Bar
  
  - Add sub-menu on navigation bar, linking to the h3 and h4 sections on the site.

  - Make header invisible on smaller viewports and allow for swipe down or hover to make it appear. 

  - Improve the hamburger menu functionality by using a JavaScript version instead. 

- #### Hero Images

  - Add a text box or scroll down arrow on the hero images to make it clearer to users that there is content below the images - as they take up a lot of the screen space in order to be visually striking.  

- #### Machine Catalogue Page

  - Include all the machines from the Horizon games to have the full collection of existing machines. 

  - Make the machine catalogue info text on the images visually more appealing on smaller viewports, for example using a different system instead e.g. modals with Java. 

- #### Sign Up Page

  - Make the newsletter an actual function of the site.

  - Create user profile and login options in order to create a true community where users can connect. 

  - Make the how many hours a day do you play selector into a range slider instead and show the 1-24 hour values with JavaScript.

## __Testing__

### ***HTML and CSS Testing***

-   [W3C Markup Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) was used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no HTML syntax errors in the project.
    - [Results index.html](assets/testing/testing-html-index.pdf)
    - [Results game-developer-history.html](assets/testing/testing-html-game-developer-history.pdf)
    - [Results machine-catalogue.html](assets/testing/testing-html-machine-catalogue.pdf)
    - [Results sign-up.html](assets/testing/testing-html-sign-up.pdf)

-   [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) was used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no CSS syntax errors in the project.
    - [Results style.css](assets/testing/testing-style-css.pdf)

### ***Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO Testing***

  [Chrome DevTools Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) was used to test Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO. All tests performed in the 90-100 green score, except for in the Performance category on some pages that came in the yellow range. Compressing the image size resulted in pixelated images and was therefore dismissed and a lower performance rating accepted. 
  - The About The Games Page scored 77 on mobile.
  - The Game Developer History Page scored 65 on mobile.
  - The Sign Up Page scored 80 on mobile and 84 on desktop.

- #### Desktop Testing with [Chrome DevTools Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)
  - [About The Games Page](assets/testing/testing-lighthouse-index-desktop.pdf)
  - [Game Developer History Page](assets/testing/testing-lighthouse-developer-history-desktop.pdf)
  - [Machine Catalogue Page](assets/testing/testing-lighthouse-machine-catalogue-desktop.pdf)
  - [Sign Up Page](assets/testing/testing-lighthouse-sign-up-desktop.pdf)

- #### Mobile Testing with [Chrome DevTools Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)
  - [About The Games Page](assets/testing/testing-lighthouse-index-mobile.pdf)
  - [Game Developer History Page](assets/testing/testing-lighthouse-developer-history-mobile.pdf)
  - [Machine Catalogue Page](assets/testing/testing-lighthouse-machine-catalogue-mobile.pdf)
  - [Sign Up Page](assets/testing/testing-lighthouse-sign-up-mobile.pdf)

  ![Colour Palette Contrast Grid](assets/images/color-palette-contrast-grid.png)
  
  - Any icons on the site that are for decorative purposes only use the aria-hidden="true" attribute to accommodate for accessibility, as recommended by [Font Awesome's Accessiblity Page           (https://fontawesome.com/v5/docs/web/other-topics/accessibility)
  ![Font Awesome Accessiblity Page](assets/images/font-awesome-accessibility.png)

### ***Responsive Testing***

  - [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) and [Responsinator](https://www.responsinator.com/) were used to regularly check for any responsive design issues. Rather than only checking for specific device screen widths, I used DevTools to reduce the viewport width gradually and noted any and all issues for each width. My media queries are based on these specific pixel widths rather than typical viewport breakpoints to allow for an enjoyable experience for all users, on any devices they use. 

  - The site is responsive down to 320px viewport widths, and in most cases even down to 280px.  

### ***Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section***

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the Horizon games.

        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image and upon scrolling down the user discovers the main section of the page.
        2. The main points are made immediately clear with the hero image. It serves to introduce the user to the world of Horizon if they don't know the games, or to plunge the user back into this world as if they were playing the games.  
        3. The user has the option to scroll down, which will lead to the main page content, allowing them to learn more about the Horizon games.  

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link clearly describes what page they will end up on. There is also a visual aid in the form of colours to help the user understand which page they are on: white for the current page, light blue for the other pages they can click on to visit. 
        2. The navigation bar is in the fixed position and thus stays at the top of the page as the user navigates the site, allowing the user to easily switch between pages and get back to the top of the page again by clicking on the page link they are currently on. 
        3. On smaller viewports the navigation bar remains fixed, but is reduced in size as to not take up too much space, and includes the site name only, which remains clickable. In order to access the other site pages there is a hamburger bar to the left of the site name, which pops out onto the screen and disappears again once the desired page has been selected. 
        4. On the Sign Up Page, after a form response is submitted, the user is notified that the form has been successfully sent.

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to locate the site creator's social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.
        
        1. The user can scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to look up the machine catalogue page, to find out how to beat the enemy machines in the game.

        1. The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Machine Catalogue" Page.
        2. The user will be directed to the page with another hero image and the machine catalogue in the main page area below.
        3. The Beat The Machines section explains to the user that they need to hover over (or tap on touchscreens) the machine images below in order for the info text to appear, which details how they can override and destroy the machines. 

    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to rewatch the YouTube videos on the About The Games page and the Machine Catalogue page, to immerse myself in the Horizon gaming world.
        
        1. The navigation bar clearly highlights the "About The Games" and "Machine Catalogue" Pages.
        2. The videos do not autoplay and it is up to the user to press the play button, making it a chosen action. 
        3. The videos can either be played on the site directly with a set window size, or they can be made full-screen - depending on what the user prefers. 

    3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to sign up for the newsletter and join the community.
        
        1. The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Sign Up" Page.
        2. The form on the sign up page is clear in its instruction, detailing three sections to complete: user details, survey questions, and newsletter subscription. 
        3. Once complete the user is instructed to click the "Join Us!" button and once clicked is informed that the form has successfully been submitted.

    4. As a Returning Visitor, I want to get in contact with the site creator with any questions I may have about the site.
        
        1. The footer contains links to the site creator's GitHub and Linkedin pages.
        2. Whichever link they click, it will be open up in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.

-   #### Frequent User Goals

    1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added machines on the machine catalogue, as not all machines in the games are currently included.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily find the "Machine Catalogue" Page in the navigation bar.
        2. Here they would quickly see if any new machines had been added to the list. 

    2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new game releases planned.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily find the "About The Games" or "Game Developer History" Pages in the navigation bar. 
        2. Here they would find updates on any new game news. 

    3. As a Frequent User, I want to have more interaction with the community.
        
        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily find the "Sign Up" Page in the navigation bar.
        2. Here they would find updates on any developments within the community, such as a user creation and login section, or a chat function between users.  

### ***Further Testing***

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge browsers.

-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop up to 28 inch screen with 4k resolution, Laptop, Pixel 3a, Pixel 4, Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e.

-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.

-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### ***Known Bugs***

-   On some mobile devices, notably the Pixel 3a the form fieldset on the Sign Up page pushes the size of screen out more than any of the other content on the page. A white gap can be seen to the right of the footer and navigation bar as a result. However, this issue does not appear on [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools) or [Responsinator](https://www.responsinator.com/)
