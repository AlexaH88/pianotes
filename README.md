<h1 align="center">PiaNotes</h1>

[The PiaNotes website](https://alexah88.github.io/pianotes/) has been developed for anyone interested in music, piano, and playing mini-games online. The user can play a virtual piano, challenge themselves in a Simon Says type mini-game against the computer, play along to a selection of sheet music, and find out how to use the site on a dedicated instructions page.

-   ### ***Design***
    
    -   #### Colour Palette

        - The colour palette is made up of four colours: 
          - Yellow #FFDE59
          - Purple #5E17EB
          - Black #000000
          - White #FFFFFF

        - The yellow #FFDE59 and purple #5E17EB were chosen for their playfulness and retro feel, fitting with the theme of the site, all the while taking into account their compatibility with each other and the site as a whole. Black #000000 and white #FFFFFF are used as the third and fourth colours on the site as neutral tones.

    -   #### Typography

        - The [Orelega One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Orelega+One?query=orelega) and [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=poppins) fonts are used across the site, with 'Orelega One' used for the headings and 'Poppins' used for the remaining text. 

        - The fonts were chosen for their playful and retro feel, taking into account the theme of the site. 
    
    -   #### Imagery

        - The piano and computer mouse icons on the Instructions Page were added to avoid having a text-heavy page and to create a playful and fun look and feel. The graphics use the same colours and style of the site in order to keep things coherent.  

-   ### ***Wireframes***

    - The Play and Challenge pages at the wireframe stage were later combined to create one page (Play), with the ability to switch between Freestlye and Challenge modes. This was done in order to improve UX and repetitive code on two pages. 

    -   Play page:
        ![Play Wireframe](assets/images/wireframes-play-page.png)

    -   Challenge page:
        ![Challenge Wireframe](assets/images/wireframes-challenge-page.png)

    -   Sheet Music page:
        ![Sheet Music Wireframe](assets/images/wireframes-sheet-music-page.png)
    
    -   Instructions page:
        ![Instructions Wireframe](assets/images/wireframes-instructions-page.png)

## __Features__

### ***Existing Features***

- #### Navigation Bar

  ![Nav Bar](assets/images/nav-bar.png)

  - The navigation bar includes four clickable links, allowing the user to easily access the three pages on the site: 
    - PiaNotes site name (links to the Play home page)
    - Play page
    - Sheet Music page
    - Instructions page

  - In order to make navigation easier for the user, the navigation bar is in a fixed position, meaning that it remains at the top of the page as the user scrolls down.

  - The navigation bar follows the same style as the footer, and appears in the same format on all three pages - this allows for consistency throughout the site.

  - A hover effect of the text turning purple, and the cursor becoming a pointer is included, allowing the user to understand that the link is clickable. Once the link has been clicked, the text remains pruple to indicate to the user which page they find themselves on. 

  - The navigation bar was created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and is fully responsive across devices.
    ![Responsive Nav Bar](assets/images/nav-bar-responsive.png)

- #### Play Page

  ![Play Page](assets/images/page-play.png)

  - The Play page is the landing page of the website and as the user's first port of call serves as the main purpose of the site, namely to be able to play a virtual piano - on Freestyle mode, or on Challenge mode. 
  
  - The page is split into two sections:
    - The play mode choice, including a clickable button each for Freestyle mode and Challenge mode. And the score board, including counters for the number of rounds played, the number of games won, the number of games lost, and a results message showing either "Won!" or "Lost!". A hover effect of the buttons inversing colours, and the cursor becoming a pointer is included, allowing the user to understand that the button is clickable.
    - The virtual piano, including computer keyboard keys to be used on Freestyle mode on non-touchscreen devices.

- #### Sheet Music Page

  ![Sheet Music Page](assets/images/page-sheet-music.png)

  - The Sheet Music page allows the user to view a selection of sheet music that they can play along to on the piano, by opening the page in a separate tab. 

  - Each piece of sheet music includes the corresponding audio file that users can listen to in order to familiarise themselves with the song. 

  - The page has a choice of seven songs:
    - The Entertainer - Scott Joplin
    - FÃ¼r Elise - Ludwig van Beethoven
    - Clair de Lune - Claude Debussy
    - Canon in D - Johann Pachelbel
    - Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy - Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky
    - Greensleeves - Unknown Composer
    - Happy Birthday - Patty & Mildred J. Hill

- #### Instructions Page

  ![Instructions Page](assets/images/page-instructions.png)

  - The Intructions page serves to inform the user on how to play and how to use the virtual piano. 

  - The page is split into two sections:
    - How to Play - explaining to the user the difference between the two play modes and how to access them, and the use of the sheet music. 
    - Using the Virtual Piano - explaining to the user in which ways the piano can be played on various devices. 

  - The user can access a popup window in the How to Play section, detailing the rules of the challenge. A hover effect of the text turning purple, and the cursor becoming a pointer is included, allowing the user to understand that the word 'here' is clickable. A popup was used to avoid overloading the page with text, and thus discouraging the user from reading the information. 

  - A piano and computer mouse graphic were used for each of the sections, to break up the text-heavy page and instantly make clear to the user what the secions are about. The graphics use the same colours and style of the site in order to keep things coherent.  

- #### Footer

  ![Footer](assets/images/footer.png)

  - The footer follows the same style as the navigation bar, and appears in the same format on all three pages - this allows for consistency throughout the site.

  - The footer contains three elements:
    - The copyrighted site name on the left hand side. 
    - Information about the site and how it was created. 
    - Social media links, allowing the user to visit the site creator's LinkedIn and GitHub pages. Hovering over the link icons turns them purple to signal to the user that there is an interaction possible. All links are opened in separate tabs so that the user remains on the site. 

  - The footer was created with HTML and CSS only and is fully responsive across devices.

    ![Responsive Footer](assets/images/footer-responsive.png)

### ***Future Implementations***

- #### General

  - Improve Lighthouse SEO score on Play and Sheet Music pages.

  - Refactor and simplify JavaScript code, to make it easier to read and avoid any possible repetition. 

  - Improve accessibility across the site, including on audio files for the sheet music and the piano, the piano keys, and the sheet music. 

  - Include an alert to users on small devices that landscape mode is the preferred mode to play the piano on. 

- #### Navigation Bar

  - Make header invisible on smaller viewports and allow for swipe down or hover to make it appear.  

- #### Play Page

  - Include the option to play the piano with the keyboard on Challenge mode. 

  - Include a cursor pointer hover effect for the piano keys to make it clearer to the user that they are clickable.

  - Include a larger version of the virtual piano, with more notes, for very large screens.  

  - Include several versions of the Challenge to make it more interesting, such as the piano playing an actual, recognisable song, and hard and easy modes. 

  - Include audio sounds for correct and incorrect guesses on the Challenge, to further clarify what has occured to the user. 

- #### Sheet Music Page

  - Improve visuals on the iframes, such as colours fitting with the site. 

  - Find another option instead of the iframes altogether as they create bugs when loading and do not work on mobile devices. 

  - Include the sheet music on the Play page above the piano so that users can read and follow it more easily. Make it interactive also, scrolling down the page as you play, and highlighting the notes played on the screen.

- #### The Footer

  - Add a back to top arrow or button to allow the user to get back to the top of the screen easily.

Rather than only checking for specific device screen widths, I used DevTools to reduce the viewport width gradually and noted any and all issues for each width. My media queries are based on these specific pixel widths rather than typical viewport breakpoints to allow for an enjoyable experience for all users, on any devices they use. 

  - The site is responsive down to 320px viewport widths.  

### ***Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section***

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and have fun playing a virtual piano and/or a mini game.

        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath, the user discovers the main content of the page.
        2. The main point of the site is made immediately clear with an invitation to choose your playing mode, seeing the as yet empty score board, and finally the virtual piano itself.  
        3. The user has the option to start playing immediately, by intuitively clicking on the Freestyle or Challenge button. If the rules of the challenge are not clear from playing, the user can easily navigate to the Instructions page to find out how to play.    

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content, including on how to use the virtual piano and play the game.

        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link clearly describes what page they will end up on. There is also a visual aid in the form of colours to help the user understand which page they are on: purple for the current page, black for the other pages they can click on to visit. 
        2. The navigation bar is in the fixed position and thus stays at the top of the page as the user navigates the site, allowing the user to easily switch between pages and get back to the top of the page again by clicking on the page link they are currently on. 
        3. On smaller viewports the navigation bar remains fixed, but is reduced in size as to not take up too much space, and includes the site name only, which remains clickable. In order to access the other site pages there is a hamburger bar to the right of the site name, which pops out below the site name and disappears again once the desired page has been selected. 
        4. The Instructions page greets the user with visual aids in the form of graphics, as well as clear headings, making it immediately clear what each section is about. A popup explains in detail what the challenge rules are, ensuring the user doesn't get frustrated trying to play the game. 

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to locate the site creator's social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.

        1. The user can scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to use the sheet music to try and play along to well-known songs.

        1. The navigation bar clearly highlights the Sheet Music page.
        2. Each piece of sheet music includes a playable audio file of the song, allowing the user to familiarise themselves with the song if they do not know it. 
        3. The sheet music can be opened in a separate tab and used on a secondary computer screen to play along. It can also be downloaded, printed, and the zoom and page fit adjusted to enable a comfortable experience for the user. 

    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to re-read the challenge instructions to try and beat the computer.

        1. The navigation bar clearly highlights the Instructions page.
        2. In the How to Play section, a hover effect turning the word 'here' purple and the cursor to a pointer make it clear to the user that this is a clickable element.   
        3. The popup detailing the rules of the challenge is clean, easy to read and explains thorougly how to play.  

    3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to get in contact with the site creator with any questions I may have about the site.

        1. The footer contains links to the site creator's GitHub and Linkedin pages.
        2. Whichever link they click, it will be opened up in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.

-   #### Frequent User Goals

    1. As a Frequent User, I want to attempt to play the sheet music songs using only the computer keyboard, without making any mistakes.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and could easily find the Play and Sheet Music pages in the navigation bar.
        2. The user would already be familiar with how to use the sheet music and listen to the corresponding audio. 
        3. The computer keyboard keys to be used are clearly indicated on the piano keys, thus facilitating their use. 

    2. As a Frequent User, I want to try and beat my personal best score on the challenge.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and could easily find the Play Page in the navigation bar. 
        2. Having noted their previous results, the user would easily be able to keep track of the clear and self-explanatory score board. 

    3. As a Frequent User, I want to see if any new sheet music had been added.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and could easily find the Sheet Music page in the navigation bar.
        2. Here they would quickly see if any new sheet music had been added to the list.  

### ***Further Testing***

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge browsers.

-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop up to 28 inch screen with 4k resolution, Laptop, Pixel 3a, Pixel 4, Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e.

-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.

-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### ***Fixed Bugs***

- Initially `style.backgroundColor` was used on the Challenge mode of the piano to achieve a purple coloured piano key as it was played - see example `function twenty()` below. This was followed by a `clearKeyLights function`, resetting the `style.backgroundColor` to white and black respectively - see `function clearKeyLights` below. This however caused a bug when switching to Freestyle mode after having played Challenge mode: the purple colour no longer appeared when playing the notes. This was due to the `style.backgroundColor` taking precedence over the `.active` class used on Freestyle mode. The bug was fixed by applying an `.active` class on the Challenge as well - see `function nineteen()` example below. 
  - Key Colour Bug Add Colours:
  
    ![Key Colour Bug Add Colours](assets/images/bug-key-colors-add-colours.png)
  
  - Key Colour Bug Clear Colours:
  
    ![Key Colour Bug Clear Colours](assets/images/bug-key-colors-clear-colours.png)

### ***Known Bugs***

- The iframe containing the sheet music on the Sheet Music Page doesn't always load, requiring a hard refresh (ctrl + shift + R) - see example below. Chrome DevTools revealed the issue being that `<!DOCTYPE html>` hadn't been called and the site was therefore being loaded in Quirks Mode - see example below. However, `<!DOCTYPE html>` is present on all html pages, and this issue could therefore not be resolved. 
  
  - iframe Bug:
    ![iframe Bug](assets/images/bug-iframe.png)
  
  - iframe Bug Quirks Mode:
    ![iframe Bug Quirks Mode](assets/images/bug-iframe-quirks-mode.png)
